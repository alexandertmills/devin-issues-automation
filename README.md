## 🎯 Why GitHub Issues Automation?

**For Software Engineering Teams:**
- **Reduce Development Risk**: AI confidence scoring helps identify well-defined, low-risk issues before development begins
- **Prioritize Effectively**: Focus on high-impact, clearly-scoped issues that deliver maximum value
- **Accelerate Delivery**: Automated analysis and scoping reduces time spent in planning meetings

**For Product Management Teams:**
- **Data-Driven Prioritization**: Make informed decisions based on AI-generated confidence scores and impact analysis
- **Resource Optimization**: Allocate engineering resources to issues with the highest success probability
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Clear visual indicators help communicate development complexity to stakeholders
